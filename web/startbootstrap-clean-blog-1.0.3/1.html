			<strong>Education</strong>
		</p>
		<p>Education is very necessary for the betterment of everyones life and thus we all should know the importance of education in our life. It enables us and prepares us in every aspect of life. The education system is still weak in the undeveloped regions of the country instead of lots of the educational awareness programmes run by the government. People living in such areas are very poor and spend their whole day in arranging only some basic needs. However, it needs a broad effort by everyone to make the possibility of proper education system in every corner of the country.
		It needs active participation by everyone to enhance the level of education system in the country. The authority of schools and colleges should set up some chief objectives of the education in order to stimulate the interest and curiosity of their students. The fee structure should also be discussed to a broad level as because of the high fees structure most of the students become unable to precede their education which brings disparity in every aspect of life among people. Education is the first and foremost right of the human beings so everyone should get equality in education.
		We must make a balance in the facilities for education for all to bring equality among people as well as equal individual development all through the country. Education enables everyone in the society to interpret with the things around them in very positive way. It helps to maintain a balance between our body, mind and spirit as well as promotes further required advancement in the education technology. It promotes the active participation of individual living in the society for the growth and development of their countries. It enables everyone to grow both socially and economically by developing the common culture and values in the society.</p>

			Things that happen to us in the beginning of our lives, during the childhood, very often have a great impact on our entire existence in this world. And the best thing that can happen to a man in his early years is some kind of revelation that would show him what he is supposed to do in his life. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that one of the most important aspects of our lives is our work, something to which we dedicate most of our time – and to choose the right option from the very beginning is a very good fortune. In my opinion, one of the most difficult steps in every beginning is to actually choose what to do, and choose it correctly.
			I wasn’t so lucky and spent a good amount of time frantically rushing from one thing to another and trying to understand what is mine in this world, what I am best at. When at school, I went as far as studying physics, mathematics and medicine on my own, thinking that I may be interested in them, but have managed to understand rather quickly that at least exact and natural sciences weren’t in my line.
			Only after a long period of search I managed to understand that the thing I do best is translation and work with texts in general.

The healing touch of a nurse to a patient in distress is a balm. My profession of nursing demands this healing touch. Financially it is rewarding. Therefore, one of my ambitions will be achieved because nursing blends an ethically satisfying job and a healthy contentment to my life.
